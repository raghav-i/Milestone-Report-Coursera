# Milestone-Report-Coursera

This milestone report was created for the Johns Hopkins University, Data Science Specialization. Trained from 3 sources of text data, namely blogs, news and twitter
from the [HC Corpora Dataset](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/dsscapstone/dataset/Coursera-SwiftKey.zip) focusing on the English Corpora, this report showcases the frequency of n-gram words being used the most. The data inferred from the 20 most common unigrams, bigrams and trigrams
was used as a foundation to build further on the project in the repo: https://github.com/raghav-i/Coursera-DSCapstone-FinalProject

The report is available on rpubs: https://rpubs.com/raghav-i/milestone-report
